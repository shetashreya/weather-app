- Tech 1: Current + 5-day forecast, flexible location input, geolocation, OpenWeatherMap icons.
- Tech 2: File-based CRUD stored in `data/weather_records.json`, client + server validation, exports (JSON/CSV/PDF), Unsplash background integration.

Install dependencies and run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs the server (port 5000) and the client dev server concurrently.
